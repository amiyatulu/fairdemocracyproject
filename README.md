Democracy is about fair and equal treatment of everyone in a country. But it becomes unrealistic to achieve when political parties have their conflict of interest, and leaders don’t have the expertise to make evidence-based policies and neither have the skill and manpower for solving problems that surround our society and ecosystem. The new fair democracy provides an elegant way of governance that separates the representative responsibility according to their specialization and can grow into any complexity. The governance is divided into various departments, and each department is supervised by representatives with expertise in the field. Voters need to have enough knowledge about the departments and their problems, in order to vote for the selecting representatives of a department. The selection process of representatives is “difficult in and easy out”, which allows only utilitarian actors to hold the responsibility, weeding out frivolous ones.

1) Fair (treating people equally without favoritism or discrimination) and equal opportunity to succeed for each and everyone

2)Decentralized Democracy, No authoritarian regime or no anarchical regime (leaderlessness or ignorant leaders lacking knowledge or good judgment) and no concentration of power, because the ability to approve policy is limited only to the concerned department who have the required expertise to make a decision.

3) Evidence-based democracy, Only evidence based policies are allowed, and representatives need to be experts in the field and each statement they make in the policy has to be backed by evidence and sound reasoning.

4) No catch22 paradox, that is PEOPLE have true freedom to remove their representatives easily without the need of all representative consensus.

5)Collaborative democracy, Collaborative problem solving, not by competition.
As all representatives have almost an equal chance of getting remove if the behave frivolously (not having any serious purpose or value), they have to collaborate in order to solve a problem, not compete for each other.

7) Infinitively Stable Democracy, Indefinitely stable government, voting will continue in short intervals like 6 months, but the government will remain stable infinitively.

8) No nepotism (the practice among those with power or influence of favoring relatives or friends, especially by giving them jobs), frivolous one just can’t stay.

9) No conflict of interest democracy, No in-group or out-group bias, representatives can take their individual stand, without considering the profit and loss of their alliance and opponent. Democracy design where conflict of interest is not plausible. Not a don’t be evil design, but a can’t be evil design.

As there are no opponent parties with their self-interested goals, and representatives are experts in their respective field, consensus to reach a decision will be more objective (not influenced by personal feelings or opinions; considering only facts) and justifiable.


10) Evolutionary democracy, that gets adapted and refined with an increase in efficiency and productivity of representatives with each election every 6 months, as bad candidates are removed by voters.

11) Blockchain democracy, without any middleman or brokers such as politicians (MPs, MLAs, PM, CM) and bureaucrats, who delay the implementation. People will transact directly with their service provider departments.

12) Mega participation democracy, with a massive number of expert representatives per department, who can implement policies collaboratively within a limited extent of time as it makes a decent ratio between population versus a department. Representatives will also assign tasks to voters, common citizens, and students to quickly get the job done by volunteering.

13) Mobile democracy, where boundaries between countries become obscure with time, the expertise of representatives matter, not the origin.

14) Inclusive democracy, people are not discriminated because of origin, color, gender, sexual orientation, type of job, culture, age, legacy, ethnicity, generation, genetic characteristics and disability.
